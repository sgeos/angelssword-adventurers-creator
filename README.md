# ⚔️ AS Adventurer Creator

**VTuber Creation Pipeline by Angel's Sword Studios**

*Design · Generate · Prepare · Export*

## What Is This?

AS Adventurer Creator is a standalone desktop tool that lets you create animated VTuber / PNGtuber assets from scratch. It walks you through a simple 4-step pipeline — from a static sprite all the way to a transparent, looping animated model ready for streaming.

No installation required for the prebuilt binary. Run it and open your browser. From source, Node.js 18 or newer is the only prerequisite.

---

## Quick Start

**Windows**

1. **Double-click** `ASAdventurer.exe` (or use `Start AS Adventurer.bat`)
2. Your browser will open to `http://localhost:3001`
3. Follow the 4-step pipeline below

**macOS**

1. **Double-click** `Start ASAdventurer.command`
2. Your browser will open to `http://localhost:3001`

**Linux and the BSDs**

```sh
./bin/start          # or simply: npm start
```

The launcher checks for Node.js and reports the install command for your
platform if it is missing. It does not install anything itself.

Set `AS_NO_OPEN=1` to stop the server opening a browser, which is useful
headless and on systems without `xdg-open`.

## The Pipeline

### ① Sprite Prep  🎨

**What it does:** Create or prepare a character sprite image on a solid chroma key background.

**Two modes:**
- **Upload Mode** — Drag in an existing character sprite (PNG with transparency). The tool places it on a colored background automatically.
- **Generate Mode** — Describe your character in a text prompt and generate a sprite using AI (requires an OpenAI API key).

**Key features:**
- Pick your chroma key color (magenta, green, blue, or custom)
- Adjust canvas size and sprite positioning
- Download the result as a PNG ready for animation

**Output:** A character sprite on a solid-color background (e.g., magenta), ready for Step 2.

---

### ② Generate Video  🎬

**What it does:** Turn your static sprite into an animated video using Google's Gemini AI.

> **💡 This step is optional.** If you already have an animated video from another tool (Veo, RunwayML, Kling, etc.), skip directly to Step 3.

**How to use:**
1. Your sprite from Step 1 is automatically carried over (or upload your own reference images)
2. Write a motion prompt describing the animation you want (e.g., "character gently breathing and blinking, idle animation")
3. Set the video length (3-10 seconds) and number of simultaneous generations
4. Click Generate — Gemini creates a short animated video

**Requirements:**
- A Google Gemini API key (set up in the Settings tab)
- Cost: approximately $0.10 per second of video

**Output:** A short animated video clip (MP4) of your character moving on the chroma key background.

---

### ③ Video Prep  🔄

**What it does:** Prepare your generated video for seamless looping and export.

**Key features:**
- **Frame Trimming** — Set in/out points to cut unwanted frames from the start or end
- **Loop Building** — Create seamless loops using:
  - **Ping-Pong** — Plays forward then backward for a natural bounce
  - **Reverse** — Plays the video in reverse
  - **Crossfade** — Blend the start and end frames for smooth transitions
- **Concatenation** — Combine multiple video clips together
- **Onion Skinning** — Overlay frame 0 at 50% opacity to help align loop points
- **Preview** — Scrub through frames and preview the final loop before exporting

**Output:** A prepared, looping video clip ready for chroma key removal in Step 4.

---

### ④ Model Exporter  📦

**What it does:** Remove the chroma key background and export as a transparent animated file.

**Export formats:**
| Mode | Format | Max Frames | Max Resolution |
|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| ⚔️ Adventurer | WebM (VP9 alpha) | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| 🟢 F. Normal | GIF | 120 frames | 1000×1000 |
| 💎 F. Premium | GIF | 600 frames | 4000×4000 |

**Chroma Key Controls:**
- **Key Color** — Pick or eyedrop the background color to remove
- **Similarity** — How close a pixel must be to the key color to be removed (default: 40%)
- **Smoothness** — How gradually edges transition from opaque to transparent (default: 8%)
- **Spill Suppression** — Remove color contamination from the key bleeding onto the character (default: 10%)

**Additional features:**
- Frame scrubber with play/pause for previewing
- Crop tool to trim the output
- Real-time preview with checkerboard transparency

**Output:** A transparent WebM or GIF file — ready to use in streaming overlays like AS Reactive Overlay, OBS, or any PNGtuber app.

---

## Settings  ⚙️

Access the Settings tab to configure:

- **OpenAI API Key** — Required for AI sprite generation (Step 1, Generate mode)
- **Google Gemini API Key** — Required for AI video generation (Step 2)

API keys are stored locally in your browser's storage. They are never sent anywhere except directly to the respective API services.

> **💡 No API keys needed** if you bring your own sprite images and animated videos. Steps 3-4 work entirely offline.

---

## Using with AS Reactive Overlay

The assets you export from AS Adventurer are designed to work seamlessly with **AS Reactive Overlay** (our streaming overlay tool):

1. Export your character animations as transparent WebM files using the naming presets:
   - `character_idle.webm` — Default idle animation
   - `character_speaking.webm` — Talking animation
   - `character_intro.webm` — Entrance animation
   - `character_outro.webm` — Exit animation
2. Place the exported files into Reactive Overlay's `public/assets/` folder
3. Reactive Overlay will automatically load and display them as your VTuber's animated states

The exported WebM files also work with any OBS browser source, PNGtuber app, or other streaming tools that support transparent video.

## System Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10/11, macOS, Linux, or FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD (64-bit)
- **Node.js:** 18 or newer, required on every platform except when running a
  prebuilt binary on Windows or macOS
- **Browser:** Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (opens automatically)
- **Internet:** Required only for AI generation steps (Steps 1-2). Steps 3-4 work fully offline.
- **Disk Space:** ~40 MB for the application

### Building a standalone binary

`node build-exe.js` produces a self-contained binary for the platform it is
run on, into `dist/ASAdventurer/`. Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported.
The BSDs are not, because `pkg` publishes no base binary for them; run the
application with `npm start` there instead.

On macOS the build applies an ad-hoc code signature so the result runs on the
machine that produced it. That is not notarization. Distributing the binary to
another Mac requires an Apple Developer ID and a notarization step, or the
recipient clearing the quarantine attribute by hand.

## File Structure

The built distribution, where the binary and launcher names follow the
platform they were built on:

```
ASAdventurer/
├── ASAdventurer[.exe]                ← Main application (double-click to run)
├── Start AS Adventurer.[bat|command|sh]  ← Launcher with console output
├── README.md                         ← This file
├── icon.ico                          ← Application icon (Windows builds only)
└── public/                           ← UI files (do not modify)
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    ├── sprite-prep.js
    ├── video-prep.js
    ├── model-exporter.js
    └── assets/
```

## Tips & Tricks

- **Best chroma key results:** Use **magenta** (`#FF00FF`) as your key color — it rarely appears in character art.
- **Smooth loops:** Use Ping-Pong mode in Video Prep for the easiest seamless loops.
- **AI prompts:** Be specific about the motion you want. "Gentle idle breathing animation, slight hair movement" works better than "make it move."
- **Spill suppression:** If you see a colored fringe around your character after keying, increase the Spill Suppression slider.
- **WebM for streaming:** The Adventurer (WebM) format supports true alpha transparency and is ideal for OBS browser sources.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Browser doesn't open | Navigate manually to `http://localhost:3001` |
| Port 3001 in use | Close other instances or set `PORT` environment variable |
| AI generation fails | Check your API key in Settings and ensure you have credits |
| Video won't load | Try converting to MP4 (H.264) first — some codecs aren't supported |
| Export looks wrong | Adjust Similarity/Smoothness sliders — start with defaults |
